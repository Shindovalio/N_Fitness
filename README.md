# IMPORTANT - THE N FIT API MANUAL:

1. THIS API IS SUPPORTED BY MONGODB RUNNING LOCALLY. IN ORDER TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, CHANGE LINE 12 IN **NFIT.PY** ACCORDING TO YOUR AVAILABLE MONGO CLIENT, ON CLOUD OR STANDALONE.

2. I HAVE PUT ALL API KEYS TO THEIR TEST VERSIONS. TO TEST THE BASIC CHECKOUT, TYPE 4242 4242 4242 4242 IN THE CARD FIELD. THIS IS STRIPE'S TEST CREDENTIALS.

3. SOME FEATURES, FOR EXAMPLE THE REFERRAL SYSTEM, CAN BE USED ONLY IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT IPs.

4. TO ACCESS PAYPAL CHECKOUT, PLEASE USE THE FOLLOWING TEST CREDENTIALS. 
SANDBOX PERSONAL ACCOUNT:
EMAIL ID: **sb-kfbkt5340397@personal.example.com**
PASSWORD: **qh@>8Bo9**

5. TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY, YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR OWN EMAIL ADDRESS. CHANGE LINES 23-28 IN **NFIT.PY** ACCORDING TO WHAT MAILING SERVICE YOU WILL USE.

6. SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF FEATURES AND NOT A LOT OF TIME, I ONLY MANAGED TO TEST THE CODE USING THE FRONT END FORMS AND FUNCTIONALITY. NOT SURE IF I COULD MAKE A FULL PYTEST TESTING IN THE REMAINING TIME.
